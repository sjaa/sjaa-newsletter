## ✨ THIS WEEK IN THE SKY

🌕 **Full Snow Moon** — The Full Moon occurred on February 1st, so early this week still offers bright moonlit skies. As the week progresses, the Moon will wane, providing darker skies for deep-sky observing later in the week.

🌠 **Alpha Centaurids Meteor Shower** — This minor meteor shower is active through February 21st. Under optimal conditions, expect around 6 meteors per hour radiating from Centaurus. Best viewed in pre-dawn hours from a dark location.

🪐 **Jupiter Dominates the Evening** — Brilliant Jupiter rises in the east around sunset and remains visible all night. At magnitude -2.3, it's more than twice as bright as Sirius, making it an excellent telescope target.

🪐 **Saturn in the West** — Yellowish Saturn can be spotted low in the western sky during early evening. Venus, Mercury, and Saturn are grouped together above the western horizon, setting within an hour of sunset.

🌌 **Looking Ahead** — Mark your calendars for February 17th (annular solar eclipse, visible from Antarctica) and February 28th when six planets will be visible in the evening sky!
