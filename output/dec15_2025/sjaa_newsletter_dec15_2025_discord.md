## ✨ THIS WEEK IN THE SKY

**🌑 New Moon - December 20**
The final New Moon of 2025 happens on December 20 at 01:43 UTC. During this phase, the Moon is invisible in the night sky—an ideal time for observing stars and deep-sky objects without lunar interference. Perfect dark skies for your weekend observations!

**🌟 Geminid Meteor Shower - Tail End**
While the Geminids peaked on December 13-14, you may still catch some residual activity early in the week. This is usually one of the best meteor showers of the year, producing up to 120 meteors per hour at its peak.

**❄️ December Solstice - December 21**
The winter solstice occurs on December 21 at 15:03 UTC (7:03 AM PST), marking the shortest day and longest night of the year in the Northern Hemisphere. It's the astronomical beginning of winter and a great time to celebrate the start of longer observing opportunities!

**🌠 Ursid Meteor Shower - December 21-22**
Concluding the astronomical year, the modest Ursid meteor shower typically peaks around December 21-22. While not as spectacular as the Geminids, it's still worth watching if you're out observing!

## 📅 UPCOMING EVENTS

### 💻 SJAA Imaging SIG: How to use NINA to Control Your Equipment
**Date:** Monday, December 16, 2025
**Time:** 7:30 PM - 9:30 PM PST
**Location:** Online Event
**Speaker:** Jared Willson

You've got a telescope, camera, mount and maybe a whole lot more. How can you run all your equipment—likely from different manufacturers—from a single piece of software? Learn how to use NINA (Nighttime Imaging 'n' Astronomy software) to control everything including scheduling, unparking your mount, slewing, cooling your camera, focusing your telescope, performing plate-solves to confirm pointing accuracy, guiding, dithering, and performing image capture.

NINA is free, capable, and well supported by the development team and user community with dozens of plugins to extend its functionality. In this presentation you'll learn how to get the most out of NINA, from configuring the user interface to setting up advanced imaging sequences that will optimize your data collection.

The Imaging SIG meets roughly every month online to discuss topics about imaging. The SIG is open to people with absolutely no experience but want to learn what it's all about, but experienced imagers are also more than welcome!

### 🔭 Astro 101: So You Want to be an Amateur Astronomer
**Date:** Friday, December 19, 2025
**Time:** 6:00 PM - 8:00 PM PST (Talk starts at 6:15 PM)
**Location:** Houge Park, San Jose (Park on Jacksol Drive, facing Houge Park)
**Speaker:** Kal Krishnan

This event is one of several different introductions to astronomy offered by SJAA. This talk provides a comprehensive overview of amateur astronomy, starting simply and working its way up to introduce advanced concepts. You'll hear about star constellations, types of sky objects and associated observing conditions, and different observing tools. Through this talk, we hope you'll see astronomy as a scientific as well as a deeply reflective pursuit, full of joy and wonder.

Using the planetarium software Stellarium, we'll take the first 15 minutes to show a preview of the night sky as you'll see it during the subsequent star party. The talk will start at 6:15 PM.

**About the Speaker:** Kal is an amateur astronomer whose passion for the cosmos began in the light-polluted skies of Mumbai with a pair of inexpensive binoculars from his father. In the 1990s, Kal rekindled his love for the stars when he acquired a used 8" Meade LX200 telescope, deepening his involvement from a visual observer to a dedicated astrophotographer.

This talk is **free of charge**. After the talk, you can check out telescopes that will be set up as part of our In-Town Star Party. We will ask all visitors to sign in so that we can report attendance numbers to the city of San Jose.

**Note:** Even though we had to cancel the associated star party due to weather, this event is NOT canceled. In lieu of the star party, we can do a few extra bits indoors after the talk!
