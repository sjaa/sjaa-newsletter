## 📢 MEMBER UPDATE

Hey everyone! Welcome to another weekly newsletter. I'm a bit late because I've been working on transcribing some documents we unearthed from the archive. It's going to be really fun when it is all online and searchable! Meanwhile, be sure to check out member observing nights this week. Weather looks great (as of now), so I hope you get some observing in!

Manage your membership at https://membership.sjaa.net. Contact volunteerchair@sjaa.net to volunteer and help make our events happen!

## ✨ THIS WEEK IN THE SKY

**January 13 - Moon at Apogee**
The Moon reaches its orbit's furthest point from Earth, appearing fractionally smaller than at other times of the month.

**January 14 - Lunar Occultation of Antares**
The Moon will pass in front of Antares (Alpha Scorpii). This occultation will be visible from Australia.

**January 17 - NGC 2451 Well Placed**
The open star cluster NGC 2451 (magnitude 2.8) in Puppis culminates around midnight local time, making it an excellent target for observation.

**January 18 - New Moon 🌑**
Perfect dark skies! The New Moon disappears into the Sun's glare, providing ideal conditions for deep sky observing. No moonlight will hinder your view of stars, galaxies, and nebulae.
