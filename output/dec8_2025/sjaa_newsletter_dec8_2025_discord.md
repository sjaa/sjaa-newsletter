## ✨ THIS WEEK IN THE SKY

### 🌠 Geminid Meteor Shower Peak - December 13-14
The Geminids are usually one of the best meteor showers of the year! This shower is known for producing bright, colorful meteors and can produce up to 120 meteors per hour at peak under ideal conditions.

• **Peak Night:** December 13-14, 2025
• **Best Viewing:** After midnight through dawn
• **Moon Phase:** Waning gibbous (some interference expected)
• **Radiant:** Constellation Gemini

The Geminids are unique because they originate from an asteroid (3200 Phaethon) rather than a comet. Look for meteors radiating from the constellation Gemini, but they can appear anywhere in the sky.

### 🌑 Dark Sky Observing Window
**December 12-20:** Excellent dark sky conditions begin this week, perfect for deep-sky observing! The moon will be transitioning from waning gibbous to new moon on December 20, providing increasingly darker skies as the week progresses.
