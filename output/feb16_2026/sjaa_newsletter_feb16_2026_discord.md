## ✨ THIS WEEK IN THE SKY

🌑 **February 17 — New Moon**
The Moon will not be visible in the night sky — the best time of the month to observe faint objects such as galaxies and star clusters. Perfect timing for our observing events this week!

🌒 **February 17 — Annular Solar Eclipse**
An annular "ring of fire" solar eclipse occurs, but it will only be visible from Antarctica and the southern Indian Ocean — not visible from our area.

🪐 **February 19 — Mercury at Greatest Eastern Elongation**
Mercury reaches its greatest eastern elongation of 18.1° from the Sun. This is the best time to view Mercury — look for it low in the western sky just after sunset.
