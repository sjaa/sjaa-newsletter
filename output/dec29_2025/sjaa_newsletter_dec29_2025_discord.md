## ✨ THIS WEEK IN THE SKY

**🌕 January 3: Wolf Moon (Full Moon)**
The first full moon of 2026 rises on January 3rd. Known as the Wolf Moon in many northern cultures, this bright lunar phase will dominate the night sky. While the full moon washes out fainter objects, it's a beautiful sight and perfect for lunar observation with binoculars or telescopes.

**🌍 January 3: Earth at Perihelion**
At approximately 17:15 UTC (9:15 AM PST), Earth reaches perihelion—our closest point to the Sun during the year. Despite being closer to the Sun, the Northern Hemisphere experiences winter due to the tilt of Earth's axis. We'll be about 91.4 million miles from our star!

**🌠 January 3-4: Quadrantid Meteor Shower**
Ring in the new year with one of the year's best meteor showers! The Quadrantids peak on the night of January 3rd into the early morning hours of January 4th. Under ideal conditions, observers can see up to 40 meteors per hour. However, this year the full Wolf Moon will significantly reduce visibility of fainter meteors. Best viewing is after midnight when the radiant (in the constellation Boötes) is highest in the sky. Despite the moonlight interference, the brightest Quadrantids should still be visible.

## 📅 UPCOMING EVENTS

### 🔭 Monthly Astronomy Talk: The (Life and) Death of Stars

**Date:** Friday, January 3, 2026
**Time:** 7:30 PM - 9:30 PM (Social time at 7:30 PM, talk begins at 8:00 PM)
**Location:** Houge Park, Twilight Drive & White Oaks Avenue, San Jose

**Talk: The (Life and) Death of Stars: Where the Elements Around Us Form**

From the oxygen we breathe to the gold in our jewelry and the calcium in our bones, the majority of periodic table elements that make up our world are forged by stars. This talk explores how the universe transforms simple hydrogen into the rich diversity of atoms that build planets, life, and everything we see around us.

Beginning their lives in vast clouds of gas and ending in massive explosions, we will discover how each star in the night sky creates and scatters ingredients for new worlds throughout their evolution. By tracing this stellar alchemy, we uncover how true it is to say that we are all just stardust.

**Speaker:** Natalie LeBaron is a 4th-year PhD student in the Astronomy Department at UC Berkeley. She studies the visible and near infrared light from supernova explosions of massive stars to learn about the elements and molecules they synthesize and interact with. Natalie is passionate about science outreach, mentorship, and removing barriers within STEM education.

### ☀️ Solar Sunday: See The Sun Like Never Before

**Date:** Saturday, January 4, 2026
**Time:** 1:30 PM - 3:30 PM
**Location:** Houge Park, 3972 Twilight Dr, San Jose

It's there for us year round, lighting our days and providing energy for our lives, so maybe it's time to give it a closer look. Join SJAA for amazing and detailed views of the Sun through special telescopes that will keep your eyeballs perfectly safe!

**What You'll See:**
• White-light telescopes with solar filters revealing sunspots
• Hydrogen-alpha telescopes showing prominences (solar flares) and intricate texture within the Sun's chromosphere
• Learn about how the Sun works and how magnetic fields drive solar activity

A few minutes after 1:30 PM, we'll have a short, informal introductory talk. At other times, you can enjoy the views and ask questions about the Sun, telescopes, or astronomy in general. We often have a station where you can get a better feel for the huge scale of our solar system!

**Bring Your Own Telescope:** If you have a properly filtered white light or H-alpha telescope and want to share views with others, please arrive at 1:00 PM or earlier to set up.

⚠️ **Come Prepared:** Since we'll be out in the Sun, consider bringing a hat, sunscreen, and water.
