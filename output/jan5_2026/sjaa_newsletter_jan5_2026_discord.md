## ✨ THIS WEEK IN THE SKY

**🪐 Jupiter at Opposition - January 10**
The giant planet Jupiter reaches opposition, meaning it's directly opposite the Sun from Earth's perspective. This is the best time of the year to observe Jupiter! The planet will be fully illuminated, at its brightest, and visible all night long from sunset to sunrise. Look for it high in the southern sky during evening hours.

**🌙 Moon Phases This Week**
The week begins shortly after the Full Wolf Moon (January 3). The Moon will be waning, moving toward Last Quarter phase later in the week. The waning gibbous Moon will still be quite bright in the early part of the week.

**🌟 Lunar Highlights**
• January 5: Moon near the Beehive Cluster (M44) in Cancer
• January 6: Lunar occultation of Regulus - the Moon passes in front of the bright star Regulus in Leo
• January 10: Moon near Spica, the brightest star in Virgo

**🌌 Other Highlights**
January 8: Mars will appear close to Venus in the sky, and Comet 24P/Schaumasse reaches perihelion (closest point to the Sun).
