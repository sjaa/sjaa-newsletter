## ✨ THIS WEEK IN THE SKY

### 🌠 Geminid Meteor Shower Peak
**When:** Night of December 13-14, 2025

**What to Expect:** The Geminids are usually one of the best meteor showers of the year! This reliable and active meteor display is consistently ranked among the year's most spectacular celestial shows.

**Viewing Tips:** Find a dark location away from city lights, allow your eyes to adjust for 20-30 minutes, and look toward the constellation Gemini (though meteors will appear across the entire sky).

### 🌑 Dark Sky Observing Window
**When:** December 12-21, 2025

**Perfect For:** This is an excellent period for deep-sky observing with minimal moonlight interference. Great time to view galaxies, nebulae, and star clusters!
