## ✨ THIS WEEK IN THE SKY

**🌕 December 4: Super Cold Moon (Full Moon)**
**When:** Thursday, December 4 at 11:14 PM UTC (3:14 PM PST)

This month's Full Moon is the last supermoon of 2025! The Cold Moon marks the onset of winter in the Northern Hemisphere. This supermoon will appear slightly larger and brighter than usual, making it an excellent opportunity for lunar photography and observation.

*Perfect for:* Lunar photography, naked-eye viewing, telescope observation of lunar features

**☿ December 7: Mercury at Greatest Western Elongation**
**When:** Sunday, December 7 (morning sky)

Mercury reaches its maximum distance from the Sun at 20.7 degrees, marking the 6th and final time this year the planet achieves this positioning. This is your best opportunity to spot Mercury in the morning sky, appearing low in the eastern sky just before sunrise.

*Viewing tip:* Look for Mercury low on the eastern horizon 30-45 minutes before sunrise. Find a location with a clear, unobstructed view to the east.

───────────────────────────────

**🌙 December 3: Moon, Uranus, and the Pleiades**
**When:** Tuesday, December 3

The waxing gibbous Moon passes 5° north of Uranus in Taurus and will occult several stars in the beautiful Pleiades star cluster (M45). This is a fantastic opportunity to observe multiple celestial objects in one night!

*Equipment needed:* Binoculars or telescope for best views of Uranus and the Pleiades

───────────────────────────────

**🌠 Looking Ahead: Geminid Meteor Shower**

Mark your calendars! The Geminid meteor shower peaks on December 13-14, just after this week. With up to 120 meteors per hour under dark skies and favorable moon conditions, this is one of the best meteor showers of the year. Watch for SJAA viewing events!
