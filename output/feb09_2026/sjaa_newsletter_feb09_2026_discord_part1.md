## ✨ THIS WEEK IN THE SKY

🌗 **Waning Crescent Moon** — The Moon continues its waning crescent phase this week, rising later each night and leaving the evening sky dark. Excellent conditions for deep-sky observing, especially in the first half of the night. A great week to hunt for galaxies, nebulae, and star clusters!

🌑 **Coming Up: New Moon — February 17** — The best time of the month for observing faint objects with no moonlight to interfere.

🌒 **Coming Up: Annular Solar Eclipse — February 17** — An annular solar eclipse will occur the same day as the New Moon. Visible only from Antarctica and the southern Indian Ocean — not from our area, but still a noteworthy celestial event!

🪐 **Coming Up: Mercury at Greatest Eastern Elongation — February 19** — Mercury reaches 18.1° from the Sun. Best chance to spot Mercury low in the western sky just after sunset.
