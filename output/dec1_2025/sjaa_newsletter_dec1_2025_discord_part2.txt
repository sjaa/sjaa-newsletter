**☀️ Solar Observing Sunday**
🗓️ Sunday, December 7 • 1:30 PM - 3:30 PM
📍 Houge Park, San Jose

Join SJAA for amazing and detailed views of the Sun! We'll be using special telescopes that will keep your eyeballs perfectly safe.

**What you'll see:**
• White-light telescopes with dense solar filters revealing sunspots
• Hydrogen-alpha telescopes showing prominences and intricate chromosphere texture

We'll have a short, informal introductory talk a few minutes after 1:30. You may bring your own properly filtered telescope if you'd like to share views with others.

*Since we'll be out in the Sun, consider coming prepared with a hat, sunscreen and water!*
