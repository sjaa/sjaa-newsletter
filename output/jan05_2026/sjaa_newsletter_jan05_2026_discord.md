## ✨ THIS WEEK IN THE SKY

**🪐 Jupiter at Opposition - January 10**
This week's highlight! Jupiter reaches opposition, meaning it's at its closest approach to Earth and will be visible all night long from sunset to sunrise. This is the best time of the year to observe the giant planet and its four Galilean moons through telescopes and binoculars.

**🌠 Quadrantid Meteor Shower**
While the peak occurred on January 3-4, the first major meteor shower of 2026 continues to be active during the early part of this week. Early risers may still catch some shooting stars.

**🌒 Darkening Skies**
With the New Moon approaching on January 18, skies are getting progressively darker throughout this week, providing excellent conditions for observing faint deep-sky objects and the Milky Way.
