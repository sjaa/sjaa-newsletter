## 🌌 THIS WEEK IN THE SKY

**🌕 December 4 - Super Cold Moon**
The Full Moon in December is traditionally called the "Cold Moon" due to winter's onset in the Northern Hemisphere. This year's December full moon is also classified as a Supermoon, marking the second consecutive month featuring this phenomenon.

**☿️ December 7 - Mercury at Greatest Elongation West**
Mercury reaches its farthest distance from the Sun in the sky, marking the sixth and final time this occurrence happens in 2025. This positioning makes it an optimal time for observers to attempt spotting the planet in the morning sky before sunrise.

**🔭 Astro 101: All About Binoculars**
🗓️ Thursday, December 4 • 7:00 PM - 8:30 PM
📍 Online Event

Need something to explore the night sky? While telescopes are the quintessential astronomy tool, binoculars are a great way to learn what's where and find beauty up above.

This presentation focuses specifically on binoculars as excellent observing tools. Not only may you already have some binoculars hiding in a closet or purchase good ones for less than a telescope, but you can also build them yourself!

**Presented by Carl Svensson** - avid star-gazer and astrophotographer, SJAA member since 2017.
